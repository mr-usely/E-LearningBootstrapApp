Bootstrap 5 Containers
======================

Bootstrap 5 Containers
----------------------

You learned from the previous chapter that Bootstrap requires a containing element to wrap site contents.

Containers are used to pad the content inside of them, and there are two container classes available:

1.  The `.container` class provides a responsive fixed width container
2.  The `.container-fluid` class provides a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport

# 

Fixed Container
---------------

Use the `.container` class to create a responsive, fixed-width container.

Note that its width (`max-width`) will change on different screen sizes:

| | Extra small <576px | Small ≥576px | Medium ≥768px | Large ≥992px | Extra Large ≥1200px | XXL ≥1400px |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| max-width | 100% | 540px | 720px | 960px | 1140px | 1320px | 

Open the example below and resize the browser window to see that the container width will change at different breakpoints:

### Example
``` html
<div class="container">\
  <h1>My First Bootstrap Page</h1>\
  <p>This is some text.</p>\
</div>
```
> The XXL breakpoint (≥1400px) is new in Bootstrap 5, while the largest breakpoint in Bootstrap 4 is Extra large (≥1200px).

# 

Fluid Container
---------------

Use the `.container-fluid` class to create a full width container, that will always span the entire width of the screen (`width` is always `100%`):

### Example
``` html
<div class="container-fluid">\
  <h1>My First Bootstrap Page</h1>\
  <p>This is some text.</p>\
</div>
```

# 

# 

Container Padding
-----------------

By default, containers have left and right padding, with no top or bottom padding. Therefore, we often use spacing utilities, such as extra padding and margins to make them look even better. For example, `.pt-5` means "add a large top padding":

### Example
``` html
<div class="container pt-5"></div>
```
# 

Container Border and Color
--------------------------

Other utilities, such as borders and colors, are also often used together with containers:

### Example
``` html
<div class="container p-5 my-5 border"></div>

<div class="container p-5 my-5 bg-dark text-white"></div>

<div class="container p-5 my-5 bg-primary text-white"></div>
```

> You will learn much more about colors and border utilities in a later chapter.

# 

Responsive Containers
---------------------

You can also use the `.container-sm|md|lg|xl` classes to determine when the container should be responsive.

The `max-width` of the container will change on different screen sizes/viewports:

| Class | Extra small <576px | Small ≥576px | Medium ≥768px | Large ≥992px | Extra large ≥1200px | XXL ≥1400px |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `.container-sm` | 100% | 540px | 720px | 960px | 1140px | 1320px |
| `.container-md` | 100% | 100% | 720px | 960px | 1140px | 1320px |
| `.container-lg` | 100% | 100% | 100% | 960px | 1140px | 1320px |
| `.container-xl` | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 1140px | 1320px |
| `.container-xxl` | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 1320px |

### Example
``` html
<div class="container-sm">.container-sm</div>\
<div class="container-md">.container-md</div>\
<div class="container-lg">.container-lg</div>\
<div class="container-xl">.container-xl</div>\
<div class="container-xxl">.container-xxl</div>
```
