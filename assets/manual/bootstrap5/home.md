Bootstrap 5 vs. Bootstrap 3 & 4
-------------------------------

Bootstrap 5 is the newest version of [Bootstrap](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/default.asp); with new components, faster stylesheet and more responsiveness.

Bootstrap 5 supports the latest, stable releases of all major browsers and platforms. However, Internet Explorer 11 and down is not supported.

The main differences between Bootstrap 5 and Bootstrap 3 & 4, is that Bootstrap 5 has switched to [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) instead of [jQuery](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp).

> Note: [Bootstrap 3](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/default.asp) and [Bootstrap 4](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/default.asp) is still supported by the team for critical bugfixes and documentation changes, and it is perfectly safe to continue to use them. However, new features will NOT be added to them.
