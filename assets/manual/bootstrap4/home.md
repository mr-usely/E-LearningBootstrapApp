Bootstrap 5 vs. Bootstrap 3 & 4
-------------------------------

This tutorial follows **Bootstrap 4**, which was released in 2018, as an upgrade to [Bootstrap 3](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/default.asp), with new components, faster stylesheetc, more responsiveness, etc.

[Bootstrap 5](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/index.php) (released 2021) is the newest version of [Bootstrap](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/default.asp); It supports the latest, stable releases of all major browsers and platforms. However, Internet Explorer 11 and down is not supported.

The main differences between Bootstrap 5 and Bootstrap 3 & 4, is that Bootstrap 5 has switched to [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) instead of [jQuery](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp).

> **Note:** [Bootstrap 3](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/default.asp) and Bootstrap 4 is still supported by the team for critical bugfixes and documentation changes, and it is perfectly safe to continue to use them. However, new features will NOT be added to them.
